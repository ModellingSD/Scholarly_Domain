# Searching
Direct searching with a well-defined goal (e.g. ’known-item’ searches) for specific information or objects of interest which also ’involves de- ciding where and how to look for information’ (cf. Palmer et al., 2009, 9-11).

# Discovering
Discovering information or objects of interest through various aids including conversational means. Foraging can be seen as an alternative term which stresses the aspect of discovery in contrast to (direct) searching (cf. Bamboo, 2010, 3-4).

# Browsing
Exploratory and open-ended browsing in a body of assembled information such as web pages, library catalogues, archival aids, book- shelves, tables of contents in journals, etc. (cf. Palmer et al., 2009, 13-14)

# Probing
Exploratory and investigative strategy em- ployed to find information in unfamiliar do- mains or topics. May utilise various ex- ploratory means such as database search, archival aids, conversation with domain ex- perts or translating unfamiliar terminology (cf. Palmer et al., 2009, 14-15).

# Chaining
Following chains of citations or references ei- ther performed as backward chaining (footnote chasing, following references) or forward chain- ing (citation searching) (cf. Palmer et al., 2009, 11-13).

# Monitoring
Keeping constantly and periodically track of developments and news in a field or related to a topic. Essentially an exploratory Activity which might entail other Activities such as chaining, searching, browsing, scanning and reading (cf. Palmer et al., 2009, 29-30).

# Reading
Close reading, but might include other kinds and stages of reading such as scanning or systematic skimming, prior to close reading or rereading (cf. Palmer et al., 2009, 19-21).

# Conetxtualising
Adding to the corpus referential structures or referential data by creating relationships between one or more of it elements. Can be seen as more special type of referring (cf. Bamboo, 2010, 5-6).

#Translating
Converting and interpreting of new terminology, concepts, theories, methods, etc. for oneself but also for different audiences (cf. Palmer et al., 2009, 31).

#Assessing
Determining the quality of an object of interest or information in terms of its relevance, utility, provenance etc. (cf. Palmer et al., 2009, 20-21).

# Comparing
Measuring the differences between elements in terms of their structural and conceptual features (cf. Unsworth, 2000).

# Filtering
Generating a (temporary) view on the corpus on the basis of one or more criteria. Can also be part of the exploration process (cf. Bamboo, 2010, 4-5).

# Sampling
Sampling is a specific subtype of selection in so far as it constitutes a new corpus (the sample) as a subset of the original corpus. Both Selecting and Sampling re-arrange a corpus into a new state or constitute a new one. However, sampling is always performed on an existing corpus (cf. Unsworth, 2000).

# Organizing
Applying or devising (personal) organisational systems and tools for storing and managing the corpus, its contents or other collections (cf. Palmer et al., 2009, 18-19).

# collecting
Building (personal) collections for current or long-term research including any kind of objects of interest and information (cf. Palmer et al., 2009, 16-19).

# Referring
Referencing or linking between two elements, e.g. via a hypertext link or by making a citation (cf. Unsworth, 2000).

# Anntotating
Adding any kind of notes or markings to any part or element of the corpus (cf. Unsworth, 2000; Bamboo, 2010, 7-8).

# Selecting
Adding objects of interest or information to the corpus or removing elements from the corpus based on certain criteria. Selecting modifies an existing corpus by removing and adding elements or constitutes a new corpus by adding the first element to it.

# Writing
Proper writing, e.g. of a draft for a journal article or a thesis chapter (cf. Palmer et al., 2009, 21).

# Assembling
Putting any kind of elements from the corpus together to form a work which can be shared, published or disseminated. An iterative and continuous process which is based on or may involve other Activities such as writing, reading, sampling etc. (cf. Palmer et al., 2009, 22)

# Notetaking
Jotting down thoughts, remarks or notes at any stage of the working and research process and independently from particular objects of interest (cf. Palmer et al., 2009, 10-11).

# Illustrating
Visualising an idea, an argument, a relationship or context expressed by text, speech or other visual aids (cf. Unsworth, 2000; Bamboo, 2010, 8).

# Sharing
Making (intermediate) research results available to a (selected) audience such as a working group (cf. Bamboo, 2010, 9-11).

# Publishing
Making (intermediate) research results available to a wider audience such as the general public (cf. Bamboo, 2010, 9-11).

# Disseminating
Making (intermediate) research results available on a more collaborative, continuous and social basis such as attending and speaking at meetings, conferences, scholarly associations and societies (cf. Palmer et al., 2009, 23-25).
